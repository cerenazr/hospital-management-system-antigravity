Welcome to this demonstration of the Hospital Appointment System.

In this test, titled "Scenario 1: Patient registers, logs in, and books an appointment", we will walk through the complete user journey.

The test begins at 11:49:57.

First, we navigate to the /register page.
Now, we fill in the registration form with the user's information.
The user clicks on the Book Appointment button to start the booking process.
The user selects a medical department from the dropdown menu.
Next, the user chooses a specific doctor from the available options.
The user then selects an available appointment time slot.

Throughout this process, the system performs several validations:
- expected **/login** to equal **/login**
- expected **/patient** to equal **/patient**
- expected **/patient/appointments** to equal **/patient/appointments**

The test completes successfully at 11:50:01, demonstrating a seamless user experience from registration to appointment booking.
