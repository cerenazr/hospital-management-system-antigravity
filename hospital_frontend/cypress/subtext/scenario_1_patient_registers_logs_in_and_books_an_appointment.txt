Welcome to this demonstration of the Hospital Appointment System.

In this test, titled "Hospital Appointment System E2E - Scenario 1: Patient registers, logs in, and books an appointment", we will walk through the complete user journey.

The test begins at 11:45:31.

First, we navigate to the /register page.
Now, we fill in the registration form with the user's information.
First, we navigate to the /login page.
The user clicks on the Book Appointment button to start the booking process.
The user selects a medical department from the dropdown menu.
Next, the user chooses a specific doctor from the available options.
The user then selects an available appointment time slot.

Throughout this process, the system performs several validations:
- expected '/login' to equal '/login'
- expected '/patient' to equal '/patient'
- expected '/patient/appointments' to equal '/patient/appointments'

Behind the scenes, the application communicates with the backend API through several requests, including authentication, fetching available doctors and time slots, and finally creating the appointment.

The test completes successfully at 11:46:31, demonstrating a seamless user experience from registration to appointment booking.
